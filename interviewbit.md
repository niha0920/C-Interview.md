## Why is C called a mid-level programming language?
C is called a mid-level language because:
- It supports both low-level hardware manipulation and high-level programming abstractions.
- It is suitable for system-level tasks like operating systems and for application-level development.
- It provides a balance between performance, control, and portability, making it versatile for both hardware and software interfaces.

## What are the features of the C language?
- The features that make C powerful and enduring include simplicity, modularity, portability, memory management, and speed.
- Its balanced nature between hardware-level control and software-level abstraction makes it one of the most influential programming languages in computing history

## What is a token?
- A token is the fundamental building block of a program that helps the compiler understand and translate the source code. 
- In essence, every word, number, operator, or symbol that has meaning to the compiler is considered a token.

## What is the use of printf() and scanf() functions? Also explain format specifiers? 
- printf() is used for displaying output.
- scanf() is used for taking input.
- Format specifiers define the type and format of data for input and output, ensuring correct handling of variables.

## What's the value of the expression 5["abxdef"]?
The value of 5["abxdef"] is the character 'f' in C.

## What is a built-in function in C?
- A built-in function in C is a ready-to-use function defined in the C standard libraries providing essential functionalities.
- Leveraging these functions helps write efficient and portable code by reusing well-tested routines instead of writing code from scratch.

## What is a Preprocessor?
- The preprocessor is an essential first phase in the C compilation process.
- By handling file inclusion, macro substitution, and conditional compilation before actual compilation, it enables flexible, maintainable, and efficient source code management.

## In C, What is the #line used for?
- The #line directive is mainly used for debugging and error reporting enhancement.
- It helps in mapping the compiled code back to its original source or logical sections, especially in situations involving code generation or macro expansion, aiding developers in effective troubleshooting.

## How can a string be converted to a number?
- To convert a string to a number in C, common functions are atoi() (simple), strtol() (safer, more control), and sscanf() (formatted input parsing).
- Manual conversions are also possible but more error-prone.
- Choosing the method depends on the required robustness and error handling.

## How can a number be converted to a string
- The most common and portable way to convert a number to a string in C is with sprintf() by specifying appropriate format specifiers.
- This allows converting integers, floats, and other number types conveniently and storing them as strings for further use.
