## Why is C called a mid-level programming language?
C is called a mid-level language because:
- It supports both low-level hardware manipulation and high-level programming abstractions.
- It is suitable for system-level tasks like operating systems and for application-level development.
- It provides a balance between performance, control, and portability, making it versatile for both hardware and software interfaces.

## What are the features of the C language?
- The features that make C powerful and enduring include simplicity, modularity, portability, memory management, and speed.
- Its balanced nature between hardware-level control and software-level abstraction makes it one of the most influential programming languages in computing history

## What is a token?
- A token is the fundamental building block of a program that helps the compiler understand and translate the source code. 
- In essence, every word, number, operator, or symbol that has meaning to the compiler is considered a token.
